## Intro ##

* Welcome to my talk about Ethereum and smart contracts
* What is Eth, let me start from terms you may have heard
* cryptocurrency, like Bitcoin
* but compared to normal money, it's fully decentralized
* with extra features
* cryptocurrency - something you hold, can trade, can pay with
* how does it work 
* it's a P2P network as well as a shared database, in the form of chain of blocks
* everyone has the same copy of the database
* it contains accounts, balances and updates are done in the form of transactions
* people have accounts identified by their keypair
* create transaction to move coins, sign by their private key
* broadcast transaction to the network
* skip mining for now

## Smart Contracts ##

* so what's new compared to Bitcoin?
* programmable money
* storage & execution model
* sacrifice performance, waste resources
* gain security, consensus and immunity to lying

* so why is program code on the blockchain called 'smart contracts'?
* because the code has its own account, not controlled by any person
* and you can send coins to it, to enter the contract
* it's fully transparent, you see the code and the transactions coming out of the contract
* it's replicated by every node -> no lying, no influencing
